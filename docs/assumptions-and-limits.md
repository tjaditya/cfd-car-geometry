# Assumptions and Limitations (Phase 1)

This CFD study is intentionally scoped as an early-stage, exploratory analysis.

## Key assumptions
- steady-state, incompressible flow
- simplified external body geometry
- no moving ground or rotating wheels
- uniform freestream inlet conditions

## Limitations
- mesh resolution not validated through grid-independence studies
- turbulence modeling selected for robustness rather than high-fidelity force prediction
- results interpreted qualitatively rather than quantitatively
- no experimental or wind-tunnel validation

## Intended use
The results are intended to:
- build physical intuition about external flow behavior
- guide future comparative geometry studies
- establish a stable and repeatable open-source CFD pipeline

They are not intended for absolute aerodynamic performance claims.
