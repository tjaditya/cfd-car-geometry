# Qualitative CFD Results Summary (Phase 1)

This summary captures the primary qualitative observations from the steady-state CFD study.

## Key flow observations
- Smooth acceleration of flow over the hood and roof, indicating largely attached flow over the upper body
- Flow separation near the rear surfaces, resulting in a low-velocity wake region
- Three-dimensional wake structure visualized using streamtracers, highlighting recirculation and downstream recovery

## Sectional flow behavior
- Mid-height slices capture smoother acceleration along side surfaces
- Roof-level slices exhibit the highest velocities

## Localized geometric effects
Velocity slices through the side periphery intersecting the wing–hoop structural elements reveal localized flow acceleration and redirection, illustrating how secondary geometric features influence local flow behavior without dominating overall wake structure.

## Interpretation approach
The results are interpreted qualitatively, with emphasis on physical consistency across multiple visualization methods (velocity contours, streamtracers, pressure field).

No absolute aerodynamic performance metrics are claimed at this stage.
