# Post-processing and Visualization

This folder contains ParaView state files and selected visualization outputs from the Phase 1 CFD study.

## ParaView states
- `.pvsm` files capture the visualization pipeline used to generate velocity slices, streamtracers, and pressure fields.
- These states allow reproduction of views and color mapping used in the analysis.

## Screenshots
Screenshots are curated to highlight:
- mesh structure and refinement
- velocity distribution across multiple sections
- wake structure using streamtracers
- qualitative pressure field behavior

Images are intended for qualitative interpretation rather than quantitative validation.
